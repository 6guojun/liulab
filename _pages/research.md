# Research

Reprogramming of lipid metabolism, one of the major metabolic alterations in cancer, is believed to play an essential role in cancer development, but the exact molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we present a computational study of transcriptomic data of HCC with HCV etiology to investigate how lipid metabolism alters during HCC progression. Our analyses reveal that: (1) cancer tissue cells tend to synthesize fatty acids *de novo* and its phospholipid derivatives; (2) lipid catabolism and fatty acid oxidation are remarkably down-regulated in HCC; (3) the lipid metabolism in HCC is largely independent of lipids in blood circulation; (4) stage-specific co-expression networks for lipid metabolic genes were identified during HCC progression; and (5) the expression levels of several lipid metabolic genes that are differentially expressed or co-expressed specifically at HCC stage have a strong correlation with cancer survival. Overall, the results provide detailed information about the reprogrammed lipid metabolism in HCV-derived HCC.
